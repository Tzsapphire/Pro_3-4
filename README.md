## Learning Docker with Idowu Ilekura

##  Assignment 1: Whats your personal definition of Docker, using an analogy:
### Docker Analogy

Docker is a platform that helps you run applications consistently across different systems.

#### Dockerfile
A **Dockerfile** is like a recipe, describing all the steps and ingredients needed to build the app.

#### Image
An **Image** is like the finished cake baked from the recipe — a complete, ready-to-use package of the app.

#### Container
A **Container** is like serving that cake on a plate — a running instance of the image. 
You can serve many plates (containers) from the same cake (image).

#### Docker Engine
The **Docker Engine** is the kitchen that understands the recipe and bakes the cake,  
ensuring it always comes out the same no matter which house (operating system) you’re in.
